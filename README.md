## I will update this soon 
A replica of the Meraki API for Mist
## API Endpoint Information 
There are four files named organization_all_[gets, deletes, posts, pulls].txt. These files are scrapes from the Mist API documentation (https://api.mist.com/api/v1/docs/Org)
This scrape as of 27/12/2021 includeds all the documnented Mist APIs for the "Organization" APIs. "Site" APIs will be added later with their own respective txt file

Inside the txt files will list out all indervidual callable API endpoints and whether they have been impletemented in this SDK. They will be listed under one of following headings:
### Completed 
The API endpoint should be impletemented and function correctly with docstrings, tags, operation and filters fully implemented 

### WIP 
Work In Progress - Either partially implemented and needs to be tidied up or mid-implimentation 

### Testing 
Likely not working as anticiptated and will be listed here until functioning correctly.


### Not Implemented
Not yet implemented. However, if it is in the list the plan is for it to be :)
